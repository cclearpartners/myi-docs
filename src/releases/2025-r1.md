## Templates for List View Definitions

A Template field has been added to List View Definitions. Synthetic fields can now easily be used for usecases such as:

- concatenating two fields in a single table column. Example: `{Name} - {Call_Date_vod__c}`
- formatting styling contents with HTML. Example: `<i>{Status_vod__c} *</i>`
- harmonising field names across objects when using multiple List View Associations

For "real" fields, a template can be used for styling. Example: `<b>{Account_vod__c.Formatted_Name_vod__c}</b>`.

The Template field is available across all reports. However, to style a single record, the [Text](/reports/text) report may be more appropriate.

## ListViewDefinition Convert Type Field

The Convert Type picklist field has been added to the List View Definition object so admins can control how certain fields are displayed. For example a DOUBLE field displays `2.0` by default. When Convert Type is set to NUMBER, it will be displayed as `2`. Other usecases can be found converting NUMBERs to BOOLEANs and vice-versa.

Supported conversions:

- DOUBLE → NUMBER: 2.1 becomes 2. 2.9 becomes 3. 2.5 becomes 3.
- NUMBER → DOUBLE: 2 becomes 2.0.
- NUMBER → BOOLEAN: 1 becomes `true`. Anything else becomes `false`.
- DATETIME → DATE: 01/01/2025 14:05 becomes 01/01/2025.

## Templating for Text Report

The [Text report](/reports/text#templating) now supports templating with the `textBody` custom parameter. The template can contain HTML and data taken from the report’s List View. This enables a simple means to display a single record in a custom way.

## Re-label Values in Data

You can now use the `dataValueLabels` custom parameter to change how a specific value is displayed. This enables handling disparate naming conventions and allows grouping of data in a custom way. See the [full documentation](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#dataValueLabels) for details.

## Remove List View Definitions the User Doesn't Have FLS For

The `fieldsExcludeWithoutFls` custom parameter will silently remove List View Definitions for fields the user does not have FLS for. Can be set at any level, from dashboard to List View Association, depending on desired scope.

Note: For lookups, only the field on the last object is checked.

## Multi-Column Report Supports Horizontal Display and fieldsInclude and fieldsExclude

The [Multi-Column report](/reports/multi-column) now supports the existing [fieldsInclude](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#fieldsInclude) and [fieldsExclude](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#fieldsExclude) custom parameters. This means that excluded fields will be completely ignored by the report. Continue to use [hideEmptyFields](/reports/multi-column#custom-parameters) to ignore fields that are queried but have no value.

When multiple records are shown, the new `recordDirection` custom parameter displays them horizontally instead of vertically.

## Link to HTML Report

This [new report](/reports/link-to-html-report) displays a link to another HTML Report, using its External Id.

## Group By in Counter Report

The [Counter](/reports/counter-2) report now supports the List View Definition’s Group By checkbox. One Counter will be displayed per value of the grouped field.

## Doughnut Chart Layout Fix

The Doughnut Chart now has a better layout in very tall rows. Before the fix:

After the fix:

## Online: Modal Display Fix

Online, on long dashboards, the modal was always shown at the top of the page, even when the user had scrolled down, forcing the user to scroll back up. The modal is now always shown in the middle of the current view.
