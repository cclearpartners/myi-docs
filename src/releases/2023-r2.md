## Deployment Requirements

<feature-badges zip>Required</feature-badges>

## Layout Migration Tool

Finally, dashboards can be migrated between orgs in a few clicks, instead of a few hours.

## Tabs

The `offlineOnly` custom parameter can now be used to display a tab and its contents only on the offline Veeva apps (iPad, iPhone and Windows) and not in the desktop browser.

## User Territory Filter Report

With this new report, reports' data can be filtered to include or exclude data from outside the user's territory. See the [documentation](/reports/user-territory-filter) for full details.

## Reach Report

A new report is added that allows to see how many accounts have had at least one Call or an Email Sent. 
This report can also be used to track accounts with at least one suggestion, or with any other child record.
