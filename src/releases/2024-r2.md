## Improved Dashboard Error Display

We of course hope to show as few errors as possible, but they are now shown more legibly when they do occur. Errors will no longer disrupt the dashboard's layout and the error's cause will be hidden behind a disclosure triangle.

This should make it easier for reps to report errors but still continue to use the dashboard.

For reference, compare the above with how errors used to be displayed:

## Inherited Custom Parameters

To make it easier to know all custom parameters that are applied to a Reporting Block Layout or List View Association, the custom parameters inherited from the Dashboard, Tab, List View and Reporting Block Layout (in the case of a List View Association) are shown as read-only fields.

Administrators can troubleshoot report configuration issues such as duplicate or obsolete custom parameters a lot faster, as they are all visible in one place.

## Support Online Queries Longer Than 100,000 Characters

By default, queries containing more than 100,000 characters will fail online. This can happen, for example, when a user's territory contains an unusually large amount of Accounts.

The `allowChunkedQueries` custom parameter can be set to enable this support. This should only be done as a last resort, after other options to improve the query have been tried. See the full documentation [here](/references/custom-parameters#allowchunkedqueries).

## Global Cache Enhancements

### Related List

A related list has been added to the Insights+ Layout Record Page to show the global caching List Views.

**Note:** The Insights+ Layout Lightning Record Page has to be activated by the Administrator

This should make it easier for administrators to improve dashboard loading times.

### List View Ordering

When using global cache List Views, the `globalCacheOrder` custom parameter allows you to decide in which order objects must be cached. This is useful, for example, to cache Calls that are linked to already-cached Accounts. See the [documentation](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#globalcacheorder) for full details.

## Custom Empty Table Message

To present a clearer message to end users, a table can display a custom message when it is empty. See the documentation for the [noDataLabel](https://ccp-myi.netlify.app/reports/table/#:~:text=of%20the%20report.-,noDataLabel,-String) custom parameter.

## Error Log: Add Platform field

To make it clearer where errors occur, a Platform field has been added to the Insights Log object. It contains either `iPad` or `Desktop`. This field can be added to a Salesforce report to visualise where most issues occur. This should help administrators troubleshoot issues.

## Include or Exclude Reporting Block Layouts by Field Level Security (FLS)

When progressively rolling out a new object or field to users, `flsInclude` allows reports using that object or field to be shown only when the user has access to it. `flsExclude` lets you fall back to a different report for users who do not have the new object or field.

The advantage over existing options, such as countriesInclude/countriesExclude, is that flsInclude/flsExclude is dynamic: as soon as a user gains access to a field, the report will be shown, without having to update the list of countries.

Read the full documentation [here](https://ccp-myi.netlify.app/references/custom-parameters/#flsexclude).

## Layout Migration Tool Enhancements

### HTML Reports Sorted Alphabetically

The list of HTML Reports in the [Layout Migration Tool](https://ccp-myi.netlify.app/guides/layout-migration/) is now sorted alphabetically to make it easier to find the one you want.

### Delete Layout Checkbox is Disabled When No Layout is Chosen

To clarify how the [Layout Migration Tool](https://ccp-myi.netlify.app/guides/layout-migration/) works, the Delete Layout checkbox will be disabled when no layout has been selected.

## Updated Insights+ Layout Creation Form

Insights+ Layouts can now be created in Lightning. This means that Insights+ configuration can now be done entirely in Lightning, without ever switching to the older Classic look.
