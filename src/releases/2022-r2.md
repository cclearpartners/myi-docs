## Deployment Requirements

<feature-badges package zip>Required</feature-badges>

### VMOCs

Add a VMOC for the MyInsights+ List View Association object.

Object: MyInsights_List_View_Association__c
Where:
Type: Full Sync
Device: iPad_vod
Active: True

## Multi-Level List View Lookup (Lightning Only)

Admins can now create List Views with lookups as deep as necessary.

Example: you can go from Call Key Message to Call, then from Call to Account and then from Account to User. Previously, you were only able to go from Call Key Message to Call.

## Package Version Number

You can now see which version of the Salesforce package is installed in an org. Go to any dashboard and you will find the MyInsights+ Package Version field in the System Information section.

## Configurable Smartlinks

We've added a Smartlink checkbox so you can choose one or more columns in a table to smartlink.

Selected columns will be displayed as a link. Each column can smartlink to a different record:

![Smartlinks](/static/img/release-2022R2-smartlinks-table.png "Smartlinks")

In the example above, the Name column smartlinks to an Account, while the Call Date column smartlinks to a Call.

## Documentation Search

A search bar has been added at the top of every page, to make it easier to navigate the documentation. Type in an object or custom parameter to jump directly to its information.

## List View and List View Definition Pages in Lightning

The List View and List View Definition pages have been converted from Visual Force to Lightning.

The pages now look better, load faster and allow us to develop the new features on our roadmap.

## Filter List Views on a User's Accounts

You can now use the $OFFLINE_ACCOUNT_IDS keyword in a List View's or Reporting Block Layout's [filters custom parameter](/references/custom-parameters-list-view). This is useful for online territory dashboards, for example to get Calls or Sent Emails for all of the Accounts assigned to the User. This set of Accounts may differ from the Accounts assigned to a User's territory.
