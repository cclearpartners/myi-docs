## Deployment Requirements

<feature-badges package zip>Required</feature-badges>

## Multi-level Tabs

![Multi-level Tabs](/static/img/release-2022R3-nested-tabs.png "Multi-level Tabs")

Thanks to the new Parent Tab field, tabs can be nested under another tab. A tab should contain either reports or other tabs, but not both.

## MyInsights+ Lightning App

![Lightning App](/static/img/release-2022R3-lightning-app.png "Lightning App")

A new Lightning app now gathers crucial information about your MyInsights+ dashboards. Currently, you'll find the framework version, a list of potentially outdated ZIPs and links to MyInsights+ and Veeva documentation. There are also tabs for dashboards and Veeva Messages. We will add to this app in the future as needed.

## Activity Filter Report

The [Activity Filter](/reports/activity-filter) report is a way to filter between activities carried out by the current user or by their entire team. It is used in combination with the new [$ACTIVITY](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#keywords) keyword.

## List View Definition Enhancements

### Smartlink Checkbox

On supported objects, such as Account, Sent Email or Call, when the Smartlink checkbox is checked, the user will be able to click the table column and smartlink to the correct record. There can be multiple smartlinks in the same List View. This is supported in [Table](/reports/table) and Multi-Column reports.

### Required Lookup Checkbox

The Required Lookup checkbox indicates that only records that have a lookup record will be displayed. You can find all the details in the [List View guide](/guides/customise-your-list-view-based-report#required-lookups).

### Layout Reference Formula Field

To make it easier to migrate dashboards to a different org, List View Definitions now have a reference to the Layout they belong to. This is an automatically-calculated formula field.

### Labeling

When there are several fields with the same name, e.g. Account.Name and Product.Name, users can be confused, because both columns will be called "Name". The Label field now accepts the `$OBJECT_AND_FIELD` keyword so that columns have a unique name: "Account Name" and "Product Name". See all the details in the [Translation guide](/guides/translations#list-view-definition-label).

### Form redesign

The creation and edit form has been been spruced up to look more like a standard Salesforce form.

## Longer Custom Parameters Fields

The Custom Parameters field's maximum length has been increased from 255 for the following objects:

- MyInsights+ List View: 1,000 characters
- MyInsights+ ReportingBlock Layout: 1,000 characters

## New Filtering Keywords

The filters custom parameter continues to become a more powerful and flexible way to filter the data the user sees. Here's an overview of new keywords, with all details available [here](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#keywords).

`$START_DATE` and `$END_DATE ` limit data to date ranges chosen by the user via [Period Filter](/reports/period-filter) or Date Range Filter reports.

`$MY_SETUP_PRODUCT_IDS` limits queries to Products assigned to the user.

`$CYCLE_PLAN_ID`, `$CYCLE_PLAN_START_DATE` and `$CYCLE_PLAN_END_DATE` limit data to the date range of the user's active cycle plan.

## Table Pagination Enhancement

The Table report's pagination custom parameter can now be set to a number to set how many rows to show at a time, or to several numbers, to allow users to choose. Get all the [details here](/reports/table#custom-parameters).

## Report-level Spinners

When the user uses a filter to change the currently displayed data, there was no indication as to when the filtering was complete or if anything had happened at all. Now, each report displays its own spinner as it reloads.

## ZIP Version On Layout in Lightning

It is now easier to see which ZIP is powering a dashboard. You can see the ZIP's name in the System Information section.
