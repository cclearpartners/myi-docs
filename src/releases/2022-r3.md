## Deployment Requirements

<feature-badges package zip>Required</feature-badges>

## Multi-level Tabs

![Multi-level Tabs](/static/img/release-2022R3-nested-tabs.png "Multi-level Tabs")

Thanks to the new Parent Tab field, tabs can be nested under another tab. A tab should contain either reports or other tabs, but not both.

## Activity Filter Report

The [Activity Filter](/reports/activity-filter) report is a way to filter between activities carried out by the current user or by their entire team. It is used in combination with the new [$ACTIVITY](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#keywords) keyword.

## New List View Definition Fields

On supported objects, such as Account, Sent Email or Call, when the Smartlink checkbox is checked, the user will be able to click the table column and smartlink to the correct record. There can be multiple smartlinks in the same List View. This is supported in [Table](/reports/table) and Multi-Column reports.

The Required Lookup checkbox indicates that only records that have a lookup record will be displayed. You can find all the details in the [List View guide](/guides/customise-your-list-view-based-report#required-lookups).

## $START_DATE and $END_DATE

These two new keywords can be used in the [filters custom parameter](/references/custom-parameters-list-view#keywords) to limit data to date ranges chosen by the user via [Period Filter](/reports/period-filter) or Date Range Filter reports.

## Longer Custom Parameters Fields

The Custom Parameters field's maximum length has been increased from 255 for the following objects:

- MyInsights+ List View: 1,000 characters
- MyInsights+ ReportingBlock Layout: 1,000 characters

## New Layout Field on the List View Definition Object

To make it easier to migrate dashboards to a different org, List View Definitions now have a reference to the Layout they belong to.
