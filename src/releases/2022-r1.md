## List View Definition Label

The new Label field on the List View Definition object allows you to change how a column is labeled for end users. This can be done using a Veeva Message or plain text.

In the screenshot above, the Event Type column would normally use the label defined in the Translation Workbench, but in this case it will use the Veeva Message named `My_Veeva_Message` instead.



## Admins can create Table with aggregation and rollup fields

Allows admins to create a table that, for example, provides the sum of sales values across orders.

Admin chooses a Group By field. All other fields are rolled up, if possible.

Table displays one row per value in Group By field.

Click on a row to show details for that group in a modal.

## Verify Lightning Page Compatibility

From Veeva 21R2.2,  Account **and Territory** dashboards can be viewed online inside a Lightning page.

NOTE: Only ZIPs created from November 2021 and later will be able to be viewed in Lightning.

## Package Version Numbers

To make it easier to identify exactly which features are deployed where, version numbers have been added to the System Information section of the MyInsights+ Layout record page.

The version of the framework installed in the org is the Insights+ Package Version field. The name of the ZIP attached to the HTML Report associated to layout is the Insights+ ZIP Version field.

## Admin Bar Chart Report Type

Adds a new Bar Chart report type. Admins can create their own bar chart and define what is shown on the Y axis: record count or the sum or average of a specific field.

## Members Report

A new, admin-configurable report that displays the members of the current HCO. See all the details in the [Members documentation](/reports/members).

## Report Documentation Pages

We have moved each report's documentation to its own page. These new pages are listed under the new [Reports](/reports) navigation menu. The old [Reports Reference](/references/reports) has been maintained so that old links still work.
