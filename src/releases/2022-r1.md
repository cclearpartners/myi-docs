## Deployment Requirements

## Package Version Numbers

To make it easier to identify exactly which features are deployed where, version numbers have been added to the System Information section of the MyInsights+ Layout record page.

The version of the framework installed in the org is the MyInsights+ Package Version field. The name of the ZIP attached to the HTML Report associated to layout is the MyInsights+ ZIP Version field.

## Members Report

A new, admin-configurable report that displays the members of the current HCO. See all the details in the [Members documentation](/reports/members).

## Report Documentation Pages

We have moved each report's documentation to its own page. These new pages are listed under the new [Reports](/reports) navigation menu. The old [Reports Reference](/references/reports) has been maintained so that old links still work.
