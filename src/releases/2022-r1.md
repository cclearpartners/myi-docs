## List View Definition Label

The new Label field on the List View Definition object allows you to change how a column is labeled for end users. This can be done using a Veeva Message or plain text.

In the screenshot above, the Event Type column would normally use the label defined in the Translation Workbench, but in this case it will use the Veeva Message named `My_Veeva_Message` instead.



## Admins can create Table with aggregation and rollup fields

Allows admins to create a table that, for example, provides the sum of sales values across orders.

Admin chooses a Group By field. All other fields are rolled up, if possible.

Table displays one row per value in Group By field.

Click on a row to show details for that group in a modal.

## Verify Lightning Page Compatibility

From Veeva 21R2.2,  Account **and Territory** dashboards can be viewed online inside a Lightning page.

NOTE: Only ZIPs created from November 2021 and later will be able to be viewed in Lightning.



## Admin Bar Chart Report Type

Adds a new Bar Chart report type. Admins can create their own bar chart and define what is shown on the Y axis: record count or the sum or average of a specific field.
