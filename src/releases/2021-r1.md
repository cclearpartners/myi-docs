## Frozen Column Custom Parameter for Home Page List View Tables

The `frozenColumn` custom parameter allows wide tables to freeze one column in place when scrolling. See the [Custom Parameters reference](/references/custom-parameters) for more information.

## Dashboard-level Custom Parameters

Custom Parameters can now be added to a Dashboard. This allows for custom settings or data to be passed to all tabs and reports within the dashboard.

Cf. the [dashboard-level custom parameters reference](/references/custom-parameters-dashboard)

## Clone button in Lightning

The clone button has been made available in Salesforce Lightning. This allows us to deep clone a custom button on the MyInsights+ Layout.

## FLS check on all MyInsights+ objects

If a user is missing FLS on a MyInsights+ object, a helpful error message will displayed and the dashboard will not be loaded.

## Split Container modernisation

The code for the existing component that combines multiple other components side-by-side, separated by a line, has been modernised. This enhances the overall user experience.

## Bugfixes for Lightning

Several object layouts that had been coded as Visual Force pages were missing Edit buttons missing in Lightning. These have been restored.
