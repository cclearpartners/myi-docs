## Frozen Column Custom Parameter for Home Page List View Tables

The `frozenColumn` custom parameter allows wide tables to freeze one column in place when scrolling. See the [Custom Parameters reference](/references/custom-parameters) for more information.

## Dashboard-level Custom Parameters

![Dashboard Custom Parameters](/static/img/release-2021r1-custom-parameters.png "Dashboard Custom Parameters")

Custom Parameters can now be added to a Dashboard. This allows for custom settings or data to be passed to all tabs and reports within the dashboard.

## Split Container modernisation

The existing component that combines multiple other components side-by-side, separated by a line, has been modernised. This enhances the overall user experience.

## FLS on all MyInsights+ objects

A chack has been done that a user has FLS on all MyInsights+ objects and fields before loading the dashboard.

If they don't have this, a message will be displayed that a MyInsights+ End User permission set is required.  

## Clone button

The clone button has been made available in Salesforce Lightning. This allows us to deep clone a custom button on the MyInsights+ Layout.



## \*Bugfixes

Edit buttons missing in Lightning for Layout, ListView and ListView Definition

These standard buttons are overridden with VF Pages and “Available for Lightning Experience, Lightning Communities, and the mobile app” checkbox in not marked in those VF pages. That is the reason those buttons were not displayed in Lightning page layouts.
