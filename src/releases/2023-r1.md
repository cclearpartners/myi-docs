## Deployment Requirements

<feature-badges package zip>Required</feature-badges>

## MyInsights+ Lightning App

New features were added to the MyInsights+ Lightning app that was launched in Release 2022 R3:
- To make it easier to manage outdated HTML Reports, the list of HTML Reports with a 6+ month old ZIP now includes a direct link to each HTML Report.
- An additional list is added with ALL HTML Reports and their related ZIP files
- Both lists are now sorted by Last Modification Date by default, with the oldest HTML report record on top

## Reach Report

A new report is added that allows to see how many accounts have had at least one Call or an Email Sent. 
This report can also be used to track accounts with at least one suggestion, or with any other child record. 

## Refresh Button on Reporting Blocks

It is now possible to show a Refresh button on each Reporting Block separately in a dashboard. When activated, the button will be added to the report header. Clicking the button will only refresh the content of the Reporting Block

## Drop Down Filter Enhancements

### Select All/Deselect All buttons are now translated

The buttons inside of multiple choice dropdowns that allow users to toggle between selecting everything and selecting nothing are now labelled in the user’s language. They used to only be in English.

### Custom label for Drop Down Filters

The label of Record and Picklist filter reports can be customised using a Veeva Message or keyword in the Title Message Key field. If left empty, the default is used, eg. the field name, as set in the Translation Workbench.

## Admin Configuration Section For Most Useful Custom Parameters

A Custom Parameters section has been added to the Reporting Block Layout. There you will find the most useful configuration options.

## HTML Report access in MyInsights+ Permission sets

Adding the necessary access to the HTML Report object and fields in the MyInsights+ Permission will make the administration of MyInsights setup easier.

## Alignment between Classic and Lightning

Some pending differences between Classic and Lightning when working with Listview Associations have been corrected. These did not impact end users.

## Improved Support For Changing A List View's Object

Previously, when changing the object of a list view, its List View Definitions remained, causing query failures.

The definitions are now deleted, with a warning label.

## Bug Fixes

- Lookup fields could appear empty when editing a Listview definition, if first a non-Lookup field was selected and then cancelled.
- When creating or editing a Listview definition, the “Selected Object Name” field became unresponsive in certain orgs.
- The Activity Filter could lead to issues with objects that do not have an OwnerId field, such as Cycle Plan Target.
- List View Associations now no longer inherit the value for the Reporting Block Layout's `limit` custom parameter. They instead only use their own limit value, if one is defined.
- When editing or creating a field and not giving the UI enough time before saving, the wrong field type could be set. This issue is resolved in Lightning, but can still appear in Classic.
- When trying to use a Lookup to the User.Role ID field in a List View Definition an error was displayed. This has been resolved.
