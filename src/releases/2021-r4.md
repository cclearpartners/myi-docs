## Deployment Requirements

<feature-badges dataload zip>Required</feature-badges>

<feature-badges package>For Package Version Numbers Only</feature-badges>

## Package Version Numbers

To make it easier to identify exactly which features are deployed where, version numbers have been added to the System Information section of the MyInsights+ Layout record page.

The version of the framework installed in the org is the MyInsights+ Package Version field. The name of the ZIP attached to the HTML Report associated to layout is the MyInsights+ ZIP Version field.

## Deployment Guide

A deployment guide has been added. You can find it [here](/guides/deployment) and under Guides in the navigation menu.

## Aggregation Table Report

An aggregation table allows admins to aggregate (or roll up) data in multiple ways. Fields can be summed, averaged, listed or displayed in many other ways.

Read all the details in the [Reports Reference](/references/reports/#aggregation-table)

## Selector Filter Report
A set of filters where one controls the others. Useful when an entire dashboard depends on the records selected in this report. Read all the details in the [Reports Reference](/references/reports/#selector-filter).

## Parameter Support for Web Link Report

The URL in a Web Link report can now be customised for a specific User or Account using placeholders and a List View. See [the documentation](/references/reports/#web-link) for all details.

### Example

Custom Parameter: `url:http://mysite.com/users/{OwnerId}/accounts/{Id}/{Name}?name={OwnerId.Name}`

List View:

![Web Link List View](/static/img/release-2021R4-web-link-list-view.png "Web Link List View")

Is displayed as:

![Web Link URL](/static/img/release-2021R4-web-link-url.png "Web Link URL")

`{Id}` and `{Name}` have been replaced by the ID and Name of the current Account, because the List View is built on the Account object.

`{OwnerId}` has been replaced by the ID of the User who created the record, because OwnerId is a lookup to the User object. `{OwnerId.Name}` has been replaced by the name of the User who created the record for the same reason.

## collapsed Custom Parameter

The `collapsed` custom parameter complements the existing `collapsable` parameter, by initially displaying the report in a collapsed state. The user can then toggle it open. See all details in the [Custom Parameters reference](/references/custom-parameters/#collapsed)

## Sort List Views on Lookup Object Fields

Previously, sort options on List View Definitions of fields on a lookup object were ignored.
