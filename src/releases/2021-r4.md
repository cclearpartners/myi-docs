## Package Version Numbers

To make it easier to identify exactly which features are deployed where, version numbers have been added to the System Information section of the MyInsights+ Layout record page.

The version of the framework installed in the org is the MyInsights+ Package Version field. The name of the ZIP attached to the HTML Report associated to layout is the MyInsights+ ZIP Version field.
