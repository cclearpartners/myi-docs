## Package and ZIP Version Numbers

To make it easier to identify exactly which features are deployed where, version numbers have been added to the System Information section of the MyInsights+ Layout record page.

The version of the framework installed in the org is the MyInsights+ Package Version field. The name of the ZIP attached to the HTML Report associated to layout is the MyInsights+ ZIP Version field.

Additionally, ZIP names now contains the minimum required version of the MyInsights+ Package.

#### Example

<span class="text-blue-500">CCP-v2021.08</span>-myi-plus-__v2020.1__-<span class="text-green-600">2021-08-06-143225</span>

__v2020.1__ is the MyInsights+ Package Version. <span class="text-blue-500">CCP-v2021.08</span> is a project- and release-specific identifier. <span class="text-green-600">2021-08-06-143225</span> is the timestamp of when the ZIP was created, so it can be uniquely identified.
