## Package Version Numbers

<feature-badges package></feature-badges>
To make it easier to identify exactly which features are deployed where, version numbers have been added to the System Information section of the MyInsights+ Layout record page.

The version of the framework installed in the org is the MyInsights+ Package Version field. The name of the ZIP attached to the HTML Report associated to layout is the MyInsights+ ZIP Version field.

## Selector Filter Report
<feature-badges dataload></feature-badges>
A set of filters where one controls the others. Useful when an entire dashboard depends on the records selected in this report. Read all the details in the [Reports Reference](http://localhost:8080/references/reports/#selector-filter).

## Parameter Support for Web Link Report

<feature-badges zip></feature-badges>
The URL in a Web Link report can now be customised for a specific User or Account using placeholders and a List View. See [the documentation](/references/reports/#web-link) for all details.

### Example

Custom Parameter: `url:http://mysite.com/users/{OwnerId}/accounts/{Id}/{Name}?name={OwnerId.Name}`

List View:

![Web Link List View](/static/img/release-2021R4-web-link-list-view.png "Web Link List View")

Is displayed as:

![Web Link URL](/static/img/release-2021R4-web-link-url.png "Web Link URL")

`{Id}` and `{Name}` have been replaced by the ID and Name of the current Account, because the List View is built on the Account object.

`{OwnerId}` has been replaced by the ID of the User who created the record, because OwnerId is a lookup to the User object. `{OwnerId.Name}` has been replaced by the name of the User who created the record for the same reason.

## Sort List Views on Lookup Object Fields

<feature-badges zip></feature-badges>
Previously, sort options on List View Definitions of fields on a lookup object were ignored.
