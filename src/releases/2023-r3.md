## Deployment Requirements

<feature-badges package zip>Required</feature-badges>

## Layout Migration Tool: Add layout selection

TBD

## List View Association: Join field

The existing List View Association join field is split in 2 different fields. This will result in making the configuration more intuitive.

Below, you can find the 2 newly available join fields:
- Main Listview Join Field
- Associated Listview Join Field

## Synthetic Fields in List Views

Synthetic fields are calculated fields which do not exist in the objects. From now on, it is possible to add these synthetic fields to List Views in the dashboards. 

Synthetic fields require custom coding. The naming of the fields can be decided together with the development team.

## Default value for Tab filters

The filter in a tab can be set to a default value whenever the tab is opened. The filtered value will be visualised in the filter and used to load the data for the dashboard.

## Multi-Column report: support custom parameters "labelsInclude" & "labelsExclude"

Admins can now use the labelsInclude and labelsExclude custom parameters. Both custom parameters contain a comma-separated list of field paths.

Description of custom parameters:

- labelsInclude: Only the labels for these field paths will be displayed.
- labelsExclude: The labels for these field paths will not be displayed.

## Accessibility List View Definition fields

A clear error will be shown to the end user when the correct permission for the object(s) or field(s), used in the list view, are missing.

This error can also be ignored if the custom parameter “skipWhenNoPermissions” is set for the List View Association. When the end user does not have the correct permission and this custom parameter is set, the data will be loaded except for that List View Association.

## List View Definitions: Lookup Object name is visible

When navigating through multiple lookups in the List View Defitions, the object name each lookup belongs to, is now displayed. This makes it easier to understand which field will be displayed.

## Reporting Block Layout: Deprecatation Display Type field 

The Display field is currently only used by the Home Page List View Reporting Block Type. Currently, we have a Table Reporting Block Type, Doughnut Chart Reporting Block Type and Counter Reporting Block Type. 
This makes the Display field obsolete.

## Insights+ Error Logging

A new object is used to log errors occurring in the Insights+ dashboards. Admins can create Salesforce reports to make an overview.

Object API name: "Insights_Log_ccp__c"

## Reach Report

A report that allows you to see how many acccounts have had a Call or a Sent Email.
