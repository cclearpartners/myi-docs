## Off-Screen Table Columns Indicator

It was not obvious when a table stretches off-screen, so users might miss data. An indicator has been added to show that the table has more columns. The user can click on the arrows in the bottom-right corner to scroll automatically to the first or last columns.

## Parent List View Association

A List View Association can now be linked to another List View Association. This allows One to Many and One to One relationships between List View Associations in reports such as Timeline. Hierarchy depth is currently limited to 3.

## Filter When List View Association Does Not Return Any Results

The `requiredAssociation` Custom Parameter can now be set on a LVA if the main records with no associated records for the LVA should be filtered out.

Example: `requiredAssociation;`

## Filter Main LV Records on Lookup When Filter is Selected

The [requiredIfTabFiltered](/references/custom-parameters#requirediftabfiltered) custom parameter enables tab filters (eg. [Record Filter](/reports/record-filter), [Picklist Filter](/reports/picklist-filter)) to impact records queried by List View Associations.

Example: A table of Accounts, which also shows a field from Product Metrics, has a tab filter on a Product Metrics field. You wish to remove Accounts whose Product Metric doesn’t match the filter’s selected value.

`requiredIfTabFiltered:Product_Metrics_vod__c.My_Field__c`

## Support for Collapsable Groups in Aggregation Table

New custom parameters have been added to the [Aggregation Table](/reports/aggregation-table) to visually group rows in a table. Additionally, the administrator can make these grouped rows collapsable and determine whether they are open or closed by default.

Custom parameters: `groupHeader`, `groupCollapsable`, `groupCollapsed`

## List View Associations Support countriesInclude, countriesExclude, profilesInclude and profilesExclude

[List View Associations](/references/custom-parameters-list-view-associations) can now be filtered by country or profile using the same custom parameters as for Reporting Block Layouts: countriesInclude, countriesExclude, profilesInclude and profilesExclude. For example, you can use this to support country- or profile-specific fields within a set of KPIs displayed by a [Counter](/reports/counter-2), or the channels displayed in a [Timeline](/reports/timeline).

## Update Record Filter When Another Filter Changes

The `updateOnChange` custom parameter can be set to allow [Record Filters](/reports/record-filter) to always reflect the currently available records. When another filter is changed, the Record Filter will refresh.

## Framework Version Check Added to Layout Migration Tool

To avoid potential issues when dashboards are deployed to production, an additional check has been added to the Layout Migration tool. When importing a layout, if the Insights+ framework versions of the source and target orgs do not match, a warning is shown.

The preferred fix is to deploy the same framework version to both orgs, regression test existing dashboards and then import the layouts. If this is not possible and you are sure it will not cause an issue, use the Proceed button to override the warning.

## Add Date types to Synthetic Fields

To avoid potential issues when dashboards are deployed to production, an additional check has been added to the Layout Migration tool. When importing a layout, if the Insights+ framework versions of the source and target orgs do not match, a warning is shown.

The preferred fix is to deploy the same framework version to both orgs, regression test existing dashboards and then import the layouts. If this is not possible and you are sure it will not cause an issue, use the Proceed button to override the warning.

## Insights+ Logs Added to the Admin Home Page in the Insights+ App

Insights+ Logs are now shown on the Insights+ App home page. In the blink of an eye, you can see the most recent log information, potentially spotting and treating issues early.

## Add Description Field To Reporting Block

A Description field has been added to the Reporting Block object. When creating custom reporting blocks, the admin can add some context and description to document the Reporting Block’s functionality.

## Enable all HTML Record Types in User Permission Set

All HTML Report record types have been added to the Insights+ Permission Sets, to avoid any potential user configuration issues.

## Timeline Bugfix

In the [Timeline](/reports/timeline) report, events on the first or last day of the period are now displayed correctly.
