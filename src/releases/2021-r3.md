## Package and ZIP Version Numbers

To make it easier to identify exactly which features are deployed where, version numbers have been added to the System Information section of the MyInsights+ Layout record page.

The version of the framework installed in the org is the MyInsights+ Package Version field. The name of the ZIP attached to the HTML Report associated to layout is the MyInsights+ ZIP Version field.

Additionally, ZIP names now contains the minimum required version of the MyInsights+ Package.

#### Example

<span class="text-blue-500">CCP-v2021.08</span>-myi-plus-__v2020.1__-<span class="text-green-600">2021-08-06-143225</span>

__v2020.1__ is the MyInsights+ Package Version. <span class="text-blue-500">CCP-v2021.08</span> is a project- and release-specific identifier. <span class="text-green-600">2021-08-06-143225</span> is the timestamp of when the ZIP was created, so it can be uniquely identified. 

## Pie Chart

A Pie Chart report has been added. It is exactly the same as the Doughnut Chart in terms of functionality and options, except the center is filled in.

## Doughnut Chart Options

Custom parameters have been added to implement common doughnut chart design best practices. Doughnut charts are hard to read when there are more than 3 or 4 categories. Also, very small categories are hard to see.

The new custom parameters allow you to set limits on how many categories are displayed (the last category is aggregated as "Others"), how many are highlighted and set a colour for all categories (for a monochrome chart style).

The smartlink custom parameter has also been added. When set to false, the chart's detail table will not smart link to the underlying record.

For more details, see the [Reports Reference](/references/reports/#doughnut-chart).

These options are available only in the new Doughnut Chart report. To avoid any potential disruption of existing reports, this feature has not been made available to existing Home Page List View reports with Display Type Doughnut.

### Examples

`categoriesMax:3`

When "Others" is clicked, the detail table shows all the records that have been aggregated into the same category:
