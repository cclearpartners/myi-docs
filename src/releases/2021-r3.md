## ZIP Version Numbers

To make it clearer which package a ZIP requires, ZIP names now contains the minimum required version of the MyInsights+ Package.

#### Example

<span class="text-blue-500">CCP-v2021.08</span>-myi-plus-__v2020.1__-<span class="text-green-600">2021-08-06-143225</span>

__v2020.1__ is the MyInsights+ Package Version. <span class="text-blue-500">CCP-v2021.08</span> is a project- and release-specific identifier. <span class="text-green-600">2021-08-06-143225</span> is the timestamp of when the ZIP was created, so it can be uniquely identified. 

## New Doughnut Chart Report

<feature-badges zip dataload></feature-badges>

A new Doughnut Chart report type has been added, to replace the current combination of a Home Page List View report with a Doughnut Chart display type. This will allow us to evolve this report more quickly, without disrupting existing dashboards.

Custom parameters have been added to the new Doughnut Chart to implement common design best practices. Doughnut charts are hard to read when there are more than 3 or 4 categories. Also, very small categories are hard to see.

The new custom parameters allow you to set limits on how many categories are displayed (the last category is aggregated as "Others"), how many are highlighted and set a colour for all categories (for a monochrome chart style).

For more details, see the [Reports Reference](/references/reports/#doughnut-chart).

### Examples

`categoriesMax:3`

When "Others" is clicked, the detail table shows all the records that have been aggregated into the same category:

`highlightsMax:1`

Here, only 1 category is in color and all others are grey.

## Pie Chart Report

<feature-badges zip dataload></feature-badges>

A Pie Chart report has been added. It is exactly the same as the Doughnut Chart in terms of functionality and options, except the center is filled in.

## Optional Smartlinking

<feature-badges zip></feature-badges>

The smartlink custom parameter has been introduced to disable smartlinking when it is not required. It is currently supported by Table, Counter and the new Doughnut Chart. For Counter and Doughnut Chart, smartlinking is disabled in the detail table.

#### Example

`smartlink: false`
