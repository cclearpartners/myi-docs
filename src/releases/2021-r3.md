## Doughnut Chart Options

Custom parameters have been added to implement common doughnut chart design best practices. Doughnut charts are hard to read when there are more than 3 or 4 categories. Also, very small categories are hard to see.

The new custom parameters allow you to set limits on how many categories are displayed (the last category is aggregated as "Others"), how many are highlighted and set a colour for all categories (for a monochrome chart style).

The smartlink custom parameter has also been added. When set to false, the chart's detail table will not smart link to the underlying record.

For more details, see the [Reports Reference](/references/reports/#doughnut-chart).

These options are available only in the new Doughnut Chart report. To avoid any potential disruption of existing reports, this feature has not been made available to existing Home Page List View reports with Display Type Doughnut.

### Examples

`categoriesMax:3`

When "Others" is clicked, the detail table shows all the records that have been aggregated into the same category:
