# Contribution Guidelines

## General

The documentation website is targeted towards admins, so use language they will understand.

## Guides

Guides are step-by-step instructions for admins on a specific topic around the creation and configuration of dashboards.

They typically contain a screencast and lots of screenshots.

## Demos

Static dashboards, to give an interactive idea of what is possible.

## References

References are deep dives into an administration topic. This is where the admin will find all the information and available options.

## Releases

The release notes for each release. Each new feature should have a high-level description of its business value, a link to the full documentation and an example (screenshot and/or text, whichever is relevant).
