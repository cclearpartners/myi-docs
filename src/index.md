## Goals

At [C-Clear Partners](https://c-clearpartners.com/), we believe that data is the core of every action to enhance customer experience.

With the sales reps being the face of your organization, we want to provide them with all the tools and insights needed, to optimize their contacts with HCPs. 
Therefore, Veeva CRM MyInsights delivers visualizations of specific data for immediate field execution. They display contextual and historical information to assist users in their day-to-day activities. 

The __MyInsights+__ framework designed by C-Clear Partners allows you to get more out of the standard reporting features in Veeva MyInsights.

__MyInsights+__ goes beyond the data visualization offered in Veeva MyInsights with tailormade dashboards no-code configuration. We focus on increasing business value and improving the user experience.

## Features

MyInsights+ is a disruptive, innovative yet flexible framework, which allows administrators to create different versions of MyInsights dashboards based on a library of reports. This allows the business to have dashboards based on their local needs, without jeopardizing governance. The framework allows you to roll out faster and with lower development & support costs. 

Admins can adapt the following items:
- Dashboard layout: the order and grouping of the visualizations can be adapted in order to create the best user experience and interface.
- Visibility: different countries and profiles can be shown different versions of the same dashboard.
- Visualization types: donut charts, tables and counters are available out-of-the-box. More complex, custom-developed visualizations can be admin-configured and mix-and-matched with standard reports.
- Data: Salesforce, Veeva and custom objects can be used. External data sources can be used with support from development.
- Filters: available at dashboard, tab and visualization levels so end users can quickly get to the most relevant data.
- Translations: Salesforce's Translation Workbench and Veeva Messages are used to automatically display dashboards in the userâ€™s language. 
- Localization: all numbers and dates are displayed in the user's local format.
- Consistent branding: the branding and look and feel is customised to your company's guidelines. Changes made by admins will have the same branding and look and feel.
