Insights+ is a disruptive, innovative yet flexible framework, which allows administrators to create different versions of MyInsights dashboards based on a library of reports. This allows the business to have dashboards based on their local needs, without jeopardizing governance. The framework allows you to roll out faster and with lower development & support costs. 

Admins can adapt the following items:
- Dashboard layout: the order and grouping of the visualizations can be adapted in order to create the best user experience and interface.
- Visibility: different countries and profiles can be shown different versions of the same dashboard.
- Visualization types: donut charts, tables and counters are available out-of-the-box. More complex, custom-developed visualizations can be admin-configured and mix-and-matched with standard reports.
- Data: Salesforce, Veeva and custom objects can be used. External data sources can be used with support from development.
- Filters: available at dashboard, tab and visualization levels so end users can quickly get to the most relevant data.
- Translations: Salesforce's Translation Workbench and Veeva Messages are used to automatically display dashboards in the userâ€™s language. 
- Localization: all numbers and dates are displayed in the user's local format.
- Consistent branding: the branding and look and feel is customised to your company's guidelines. Changes made by admins will have the same branding and look and feel.
