* Enable Lightning Access for user.Â See [how can You can assign the 'Lightning Experience User' permission to a set of users](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/136083/how-can-you-can-assign-the-lightning-experience-user-permission-to-a-set-of-us/136084)
* Verify that users have access to MyInsightsService Apex class. This should be provided in the Insights+ permission sets.
* The HTML Report ZIP must be from November 2021 or later
* The HTML Report's platform must be Lightning
