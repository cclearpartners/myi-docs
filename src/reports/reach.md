### Configuration
The report requires a main listview containing the accounts that are subject to the reach report.

Next to the main listview, an additional Listview Association has to be configured:
Create a OneToMany Listview Assoctiation for the Object that will determine wether an account is reached or not. 
Make sure the LVA is mapped correctly tot the main listview's Accounts.
