A button that allows users to reload the tab's reports. This is useful when data is updated in a different dashboard. For example when the user drills down from a Territory dashboard to an Account dashboard and submits a Call. After returning to the Territory dashboard, the Reload Tab button allows the user to update the reports with the newly-created Call.
